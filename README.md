# OvercomplicatedHelloWorlds
I am trying to needlessly complicate Hello World as much as possible. Each iteration currently builds on (or rather, further complicates) the previous one, but in the future I may shift gears and take a completely different approach.

Contributions are welcome, even non-C++ contributions :)
